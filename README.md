# DSA-Practice 🚀

This repository contains my personal practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
The goal is to build a strong understanding of DSA concepts by solving problems from platforms like:

- LeetCode
- GeeksforGeeks (GFG)
- InterviewBit
- Codeforces
- and more...
